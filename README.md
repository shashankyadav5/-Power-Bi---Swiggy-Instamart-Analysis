ðŸŒŸ Excited to Share My Latest Power BI Project: Swiggy Instamart Analysis! ðŸŒŸ

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my recent project focused on Swiggy Instamart. The goal was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution, using a variety of KPIs and visualizations in Power BI.

Key Objectives and Insights:

ðŸ”¹ Total Sales: Analyzed the overall revenue generated from all items sold to gauge the financial health of Swiggy Instamart.

ðŸ”¹ Average Sales: Calculated the average revenue per sale to understand the profitability of each transaction.

ðŸ”¹ Number of Items: Counted the total different items sold, providing insights into product popularity.

ðŸ”¹ Average Rating: Assessed customer satisfaction by analyzing the average rating for items sold.

ðŸ”¹ Sales by Outlet Size: Utilized Donut/Pie Charts to explore the correlation between outlet size and total sales, revealing valuable insights on how outlet dimensions impact revenue.

ðŸ”¹ Sales by Outlet Location: Created Funnel Maps to visualize the geographic distribution of sales, highlighting high-performing areas and opportunities for expansion.

ðŸ”¹ All Metrics by Outlet Type: Developed a Matrix Card to present a comprehensive view of all key metrics (Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, Average Rating) broken down by different outlet types, offering a detailed perspective on performance across various categories.

This project has been an incredible journey, leveraging the power of data visualization to uncover actionable insights and drive optimization. Power BI proved to be an invaluable tool in transforming raw data into meaningful business intelligence.

Looking forward to implementing these learnings in future projects and continuing to explore the endless possibilities of data analytics!
